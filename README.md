# Election Voting System Simulator

## Overview
This project simulates various voting systems across multiple electoral ridings, allowing users to compare outcomes under different voting methods. Users can choose from systems such as Plurality, Approval, Range, Borda, and Instant Runoff Voting (IRV) to see how different methods impact election results.

## Features
- Supports multiple voting systems:
  - **Plurality**: Candidate with the most votes wins.
  - **Approval**: Each voter can vote for as many candidates as they approve of.
  - **Range**: Voters rate candidates within a given range, and the candidate with the highest average score wins.
  - **Borda**: Candidates receive points based on ranking, and the one with the most points wins.
  - **Instant Runoff Voting (IRV)**: Eliminates the lowest-ranked candidate iteratively until a candidate achieves a majority.
- Simulates election outcomes across individual or all ridings.
- Provides user-friendly prompts to select a voting system, choose a riding, and display results.
